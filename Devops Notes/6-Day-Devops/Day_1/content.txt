In the first day 

He explained us what is devops, pipelines, why devops is needed and how it works

DevOps is a cultural and technical approach that combines software development (Dev) and IT operations (Ops) to enable faster, more reliable, and 
more collaborative software delivery. Rather than working in isolated silos, development and operations teams come together to streamline 
processes and ensure continuous feedback. At its core, DevOps emphasizes automation, collaboration, and integration to improve the speed and
quality of software deployment.One of the key components of DevOps is the pipeline, which is essentially an automated workflow that takes code
through various stages—like building, testing, and deploying—until it reaches production. This pipeline ensures that every code change goes 
through a consistent and efficient process, reducing human error and manual intervention.But why is DevOps needed in the first place? In 
traditional models, there were delays, miscommunications, and bottlenecks between developers writing code and operations deploying it. DevOps 
solves this by introducing practices like Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD), which enable teams to deliver features 
quickly, fix bugs faster, and respond to user needs in real time. It improves collaboration, boosts efficiency, and allows companies to innovate 
without being slowed down by outdated processes.In practice, DevOps works by using a combination of tools and principles. Teams use version 
control systems like Git to manage code, CI/CD tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions to automate the pipeline, containerization tools like Docker
for consistent environments, and monitoring tools to ensure reliability after deployment. Ultimately, DevOps isn’t just about tools—it's a 
mindset shift that brings speed, stability, and shared responsibility to the entire software lifecycle.


4 factors for successive business
		1.faster delivery of services
		2.quality- you should not compromise with quality
		3.lesser spening
		4.availabilty of the services
		
thats why we use cloud

cloud is the remote services
data center is the collection of servers

two types of services:
	1.public cloud 
	2.private cloud
	
cloud provides 3 types of services
	1.IaaS
	2.PaaS
	3.SaaS
	
aws is going to provide the following services:
	1.provides autoservice
	2.availability of services (99.11)%
	3.on demand ..( gonna support any service when needed)
	
services which are important for us in aws menu
	1.compute option (ec2 services) to deploy aplications in the cloud
	2.containers.(eks- Elastic kubernetes service)
	3.databases (dynamoDB,rds -relation database services)
	
	
compute -ec2
	1.os
	2.server configuration
	3.storage
	
	
if we have to give any permission in amzon linux we should use visudo file

there 2 family in linux servers
	red hat family- amazon linux,oracle linux,sussi linux,redhat linux
	
	whenever we are using redhat family we have to install httpd ( hyper text transfer protocol, d means deamon server)
	
	debian family
	ubuntu os , debian os 
	whenever using debian family we have to use apachelinux server or enginex server
	
how to install any packages we should use " yum " command
 	y-yello
 	u-update
 	m-modify
 	
 which httpd
 
 service httpd status
 if dead: service httpd start
